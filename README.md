# Body-Signal-of-Smoking
Using Machine Learning Model to know that there is a relation between smoker and their body signal that affected to their health.

**Introduction **
- Problem Statement :
The increasing prevalence of smoking in society can have serious healthconsequences. Identifying smokers and non-smokers through bodysignal analysis can be an effective solution to support health preventionand intervention programs. Therefore, an innovative approach usingmachine learning technology is needed to understand body signalpatterns that can differentiate between smokers and non-smokers.
- Objectives :
* Develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing patterns in
  body signals associated with smoking habits.
* Investigate and understand the specific characteristics of body signal
  data that can be used to differentiate between smokers and non-
  smokers.
* Present information that can support health prevention and
  intervention efforts by gaining a deeper understanding of the body
  signals indicative of smoking behavior.
- Data Description :
  The data used in this modelling consisted of information about varioushealth conditions and the smoking status of individuals, which can bevaluable for analyzing the relationship between smoking 
  behavior andhealth outcomes. This type of data can be used to develop insights andpredictive models using machine learning techniques to understand thepatterns of body signals associated with 
  smoking habits and non-smokingstatus
  
**Conclusion **
Both the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression models were evaluated on the test dataset. The SVM model achieved an accuracy of approximately 73.94%, while the Logistic Regression model achieved a slightly higher accuracy of approximately 74.09%. These results indicate that both models perform similarly in predicting the health outcomes related to smoking, with Logistic Regression having a marginal edge in accuracy. From the data analysis and machine learning modeling that we have carried out, vital signs from the human body have been proven to be able to prove whether a person is in the category of smoker or not.
